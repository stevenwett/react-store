# React Store Test Site

This is a test site to play around with React.

To get started with this project:
* Create a local directory, `cd ~/Sites/` and `mkdir react-store`
* Go into that directory `cd react-test`
* Clone this repo to the current directory `git clone https://github.com/stevenwett/react-store.git .`
* Go into the project folder `cd store`
* Run npm to get started `npm start` and the project should popup in your browser, running locally


To get started with a new React project:

* Run `npx create-react-app my-app` with 'my-app' being the name of your project
* Go into the new directory that it created
* Run npm to get started `npm start` and now you're cruising
